        <div className='lg:w-full w-full h-[1px] bg-gray-400'></div>
        <p className='text-white my-5'>Zantac® and its generic versions, ranitidine, are very popular heartburn/antacid medications that have been on the market since the early 1980s. They belong to a group of drugs called histamine-2 blockers. Zantac® (ranitidine) works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. It is mainly used to treat acid reflux and other conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and other gastrointestinal issues. Zantac® and other generic versions of ranitidine are available over the counter (Zantac® OTC) and by prescription. Dosages vary between 75 and 150 mg tablets, though some patients take a once daily 300 mg dosage. Zantac® and its generic versions, ranitidine are some of the most widely used medications of all time.</p>
        <p className='text-white mb-5'>In September 2019, Valisure, an online pharmacy based in Connecticut, informed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that it had found the cancer-causing chemical N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in some batches of Zantac® (ranitidine). Shortly after the FDA announcement, retailers including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid pulled prescription and over-the-counter formulas of Zantac® from their shelves.</p>
        <h3 className='text-white text-center lg:text-3xl text-xl mt-16 mb-5'>MORE ABOUT NDMA (N-NITROSOSDIMETHYLAMINE)</h3>
        <p className='mb-5 text-white'>NDMA is an industrial chemical used in gasoline, rocket fuel and other petroleum-based industrial products and is a known human carcinogen. NDMA levels in Zantac® may be 3,000 to 26,000 times higher than legally allowed levels set by the FDA.</p>
        <p className='mb-5 text-white'>Since the 1980s, numerous studies have demonstrated a link between the NDMA in Zantac® and cancer. Mounting evidence also allegedly shows that Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim, the big pharma companies that make Zantac® (ranitidine hydrochloride), concealed the Zantac® cancer link from millions of people who took the drug for heartburn, gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sour stomach, Barrett’s esophagus, acid reflux and other issues. This deception came as the companies made unprecedented profits from Zantac®, the first drug to generate $1 billion in sales.</p>
