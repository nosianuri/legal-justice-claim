        <p className='text-white my-5'>People get injured every day, be it in automobiles, motorcycles, a slip and fall, work related accidents, medical malpractice, a faulty/defective product, and so many other ways. All property and product owners need to ensure the safety of their consumers or visitors/safe environments for any visitor. When the injury occurs, most people just go to the doctor or hospital and pay out of their own pocket or with their own insurance. Depending on the negligence level or intent, the severity of the injury, you may be entitled to compensation for your injury. Billions of dollars have been won just by consulting an attorney and filing a lawsuit if deemed applicable.
