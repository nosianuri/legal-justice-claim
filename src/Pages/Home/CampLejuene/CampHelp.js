                    <p className='mt-5 text-[18px] text-justify'>Back in 1982, routine water testing at Camp Lejeune uncovered some startling findings. The drinking water sources were contaminated with a dangerous cocktail of benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene, or perchloroethylene (PCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). These hazardous chemicals are known to be carcinogenic and pose serious risks to human health. But get this: the contamination levels were off the charts! We're talking up to 300 times the acceptable levels in some cases! It's a wonder anyone survived drinking that toxic water. It's no wonder there are legal claims still being made today.
