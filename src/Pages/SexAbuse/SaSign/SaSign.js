                    <p className='my-5'>Sexual Abuse and sexual assault have been happening in the SBC churches for a while. In the published report (Report of the Independent Investigation) by Guidepost Solutions. There is documented evidence of intimidation of victims and concealment of claims by SBC staff. According to the SBC not addressing the sexual abuse issue with other member churches is because under SBC polity the church has no responsibility for addressing the issue let with these autonomous churches, in charge of their own hiring, and not under the control of the SBC. For the SBC to use this rule as an excuse to not communicate a problem that endangered its members is nonsensical.</p>
                    <p className='my-5'>Additionally, the Houston Chronicle published a series of articles detailing sexual abuse and sexual misconduct allegations against many of the SBC clergy and church leaders. In the series of articles published by Chronicles at least 700 people, most infants – reported being sexually abused. The SBC had an opportunity to stop some of the abuse had it not been for its negligent behavior in mishandling the complaints reported by its members. Similarly, cases of sexual abuse have occurred in other religious organizations like in the catholic church. To settle this kind of abuse the catholic dioceses across the United States have paid more than $3 billion dollars to victims of clergy abuse.</p>
