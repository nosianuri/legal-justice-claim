        <p className='text-white my-5'>Camp Lejeune is a massive Marine Corps base and military training facility that covers nearly 250 square miles in Onslow County, North Carolina. Camp Lejeune was first opened in 1942. It has been used as both a base of operations for the Marine Corps and a military operations and training facility used by various branches of the armed forces. Since its founding in 1942, Camp Lejeune has been a temporary or permanent home for thousands of military service members and their families. It has also been a home or place of work for thousands more civilian employees and contractors. Camp Lejeune had its own public water system to supply these soldiers and civilians with potable water.</p>
        <p className='text-white mb-5'>Routine water testing in 1982 found that drinking water sources at Camp Lejeune were contaminated with benzene, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene, or perchloroethylene (PCE), and vinyl chloride (VC), all of which are known to be carcinogenic or harmful to humans. Contamination of water was documented at up to 300 times acceptable levels in some cases. The main chemicals involved were volatile organic compounds (VOCs), however, more than 70 chemicals have been identified as contaminants at Camp Lejeune.</p>
        <h3 className='text-white text-center lg:text-3xl text-xl mt-10 mb-5'>Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022:</h3>
        <p className='mb-5 text-white'>The Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 is a bipartisan bill intended to ensure that individuals – veterans, their family members or other individuals living or working at the base between 1953 and 1987 – who were harmed by water contamination at Camp Lejeune receive fair compensation. Many of these individuals have had their claims inappropriately denied or delayed, resulting in additional harm.</p>
        <p className='mb-5 text-white'>The Bill is making its way through Congress as part of the Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on March 4, 2022. The Act will permit people who worked, lived, or were exposed in-utero, to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune between 1953 and 1987, to file a claim in U.S. federal court.</p>
        <h3 className='text-white text-center lg:text-3xl text-xl mt-10 mb-5'>June 16, 2022, Camp Lejeune Legislative Update:</h3>
        <p className='mb-5 text-white'>Republicans and Democrats came together today in a resounding 84-16 vote for the 19 million veterans in the U.S. today, we look forward to working with all lawyers and legal vendors who share the goal of settling the debts owed to the millions of veterans who served and sacrificed on our country’s behalf.</p>
