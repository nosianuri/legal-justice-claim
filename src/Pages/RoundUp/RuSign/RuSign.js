                    <p className='mt-5'>Some people who have been exposed to Roundup® have developed a form of blood cancer called Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). The cancer begins in the body’s lymphatic system, part of the circulatory system and an important part of the immune system. It can affect either the B cells or T cells (both types of white blood cells). The most common forms of NHL begins in the B cells. In 2016, more than 72,000 new cases of NHL were expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. and about 20,000 people were expected to die from the cancer the same year. Symptoms of NHL can include painless and swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpit, or groin, abdominal pain or swelling, chest pain, coughing, trouble breathing, fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. These symptoms often mimic those of other diseases so it is important to consult a doctor if you are seeing any of these signs.</p>

                    <p className='my-5'>A California jury recently ordered Monsanto to pay $2 Billion million for not warning of cancer risks from the company's weed-killer Roundup®. Another jury ordered $289 million to pay to a groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson who used Roundup® regularly for his job at a San Francisco Bay Area school. A third jury is also awarding hundreds of millions in damages in another case.</p>
